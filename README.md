# Multiply-test
An app that tests you on a multiplication table of your choice up to 999. My first Kotlin project in the Android world

It is composed of three screens:

- FIRST SCREEN: you choose the multiplication table you want to practice with.
- SECOND SCREEN: The app tests you for each question of the table up to number 10, correcting the answer after every question.
- THIRD & FINAL SCREEN: It returns the final result for the test, and lets the user test a new table.


NEW FUNCTIONALITY ADDED: TEST

You can now choose for the app to test you on a multiplication table:

- FIRST SCREEN: You choose the multiplication table you want to practice with, and the number of random questions you want to be asked.
- SECOND SCREEN: the app tests you up to the number of questions chosen, for the selected table.
- FINAL SCREEN: It returns the final result for the test, and lets the user test a new table.

It's my first Android project and my first encounter with Kotlin
